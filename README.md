Mask Detection using Deep Learning
This repository contains the code for a mask detection project developed as part of an internship at CodeClause. The project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in an image using deep learning techniques.

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mask-detection.git
cd mask-detection
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Download or gather your dataset and organize it into appropriate folders (with_mask and without_mask).
Train the mask detection model by running train_model.py.
Run the mask detection on a single image using mask_detection.py.
Results
After training the model, you can use the mask_detection.py script to detect masks in individual images. The script will display the image with bounding boxes and labels indicating whether a mask is detected or not.
